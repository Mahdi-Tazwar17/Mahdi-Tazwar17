##                                             Hello, I'm Mahdi Tazwar
CSE @ BRAC University — graduated OCT 2025
I am a Computer Science and Engineering graduate (OCT 2025) from BRAC University, Bangladesh, with a strong passion for web development, cybersecurity, and data analysis. Knowledge in full-stack application development and penetration testing. I thrive at the intersection of software and hardware, where I work on developing data-driven, impactful, and real-world solutions.

I explore the dynamic intersection of software and hardware through both academic and personal projects. My core goal is to innovate and solve real-world problems that truly matter. I have an interest in cybersecurity. I’m always eager to explore new technologies and take on meaningful challenges that drive innovation.
